# List1 & List2 Assignment

Contributing authors: Chris Wilson, Koren Niles.

For this assignment, you'll be completing some list manipulation functions within the list1.py and list2.py files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

[list1.py](./list1.py) -- Complete the list functions in list1.py,
based on your knowledge of Python list iteration and indexing.

[list2.py](./list2.py) -- Additional list function completions.

## PR (Pull Request) Workflow for this Assignment

1. _Fork_ this repository into your own personal github account.
2. Then _Clone_ your own repo to your local development machine.
3. Create a separate branch named `dev`, and checkout the branch.
4. Commit your changes, then `git push` the branch back to your own github account.
5. From your own Github repo, create a pull request (PR) from your `dev` branch back to your own master.
6. Copy/Paste the URL **link to your PR** as your assignment submission.
7. Your grader will post code review comments inline with your code, in your github account. Be sure to respond to any comments and make requested changes. **RESUBMIT** a new link to your PR after making changes. This is the code review iteration cycle.
